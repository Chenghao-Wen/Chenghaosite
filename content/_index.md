**Chenghao's Hometown**

This is Chenghao Wen, a young individual constantly exploring my interests.

***[Please check out my CV here.](\files\ChenghaowenCV.pdf)*** 

I am looking for a research-based master's and PhD program in 2025 fall, here is a ***[frustrating story](en\2024\12\04\first-post)*** about my 2024 fall enrollment

I was born in Shicheng County, Jiangxi Province, China, a small town filled with the fragrance of lotus flowers. In 2020, I traveled across the country to attend Southeast University in Nanjing as an Honors Class member, where I completed my Bachelor's degree in Information Engineering.

During my undergraduate years, I set out with confusion about my future but gradually found my path through participating in academic competitions, entrepreneurship competitions, and scientific research. Eventually, I discovered my enduring passion in the field of **Computer Vision and Autonomous Driving.**
