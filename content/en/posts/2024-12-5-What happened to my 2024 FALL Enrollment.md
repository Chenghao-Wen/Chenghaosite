In 2023 FALL, when I was still an exchange student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, I submitted my application for 2024 FALL for several research-based Master's programs in Canada. Because the tuition for a research-based student in Canada is relatively low, and many of the programs would provide scholarships for students. I was successfully admitted to McMaster University to pursue a MASc(Master of Applied Science) degree with a respectable supervisor.

After confirming my application to McMaster University, I rejected several other offers and started to prepare for my application for a Canada Study permit. My submission to the study permit was done back in April. The process consists of several steps: Eligibility Check, Background Check, Medical Exam, Biometrics Collection. I finished the Medical Exam and Biometrics Collection in May, and my eligibility check was passed on June 18. And my background check started.

Sadly, till now, the background check has not been finished, covering a timeline of 6 months. I have tried all possible measures, including calling IRCC, web forming IRCC, ATIP Request, and even leaving mandamus in Canada Federal Court, but none of these measures worked out.

I have applied for a deferral on my offer to 2025 Spring in August. However, enrollment in 2025 Fall still seems impossible for me at this point(12.5/2024).

I know this could be a political factor that I could not control, and I am carrying out some research under the supervision of my undergraduate supervisor. However, I still feel frustrated about the deferral of my graduate program. Hence I have decided to resubmit my application for 2025 FALL and seek a RA position for the coming months.
